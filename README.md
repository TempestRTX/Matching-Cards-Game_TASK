# Matching Cards Game (Unity, C#)

A memory card matching game built in Unity using a **mix of State Machine and Singleton patterns** for clean architecture and maintainability.

---

## ðŸ›  Project Overview
This project demonstrates a structured approach to building a Unity game using:
- **Singleton Managers** for shared systems
- **State Machine** for handling game flow and transitions
- **Event-driven architecture** to decouple UI and logic
- **Save/Load system** for persisting gameplay progress

---

## ðŸŽ® Core Features
- Multiple grid layouts (e.g., 2Ã—2, 2Ã—3, 5Ã—6)
- Smooth card flipping animations
- Combo-based scoring with match/mismatch rules
- Parallel interaction â€” no hard blocking while checking matches
- Save/Load game state mid-session
- Auto-delete save data on level completion

---

## ðŸ§© Architecture & Design Patterns
### **1. State Machine**
- Game flow is controlled by a state machine to manage transitions (e.g., Main Menu â†’ Game Play â†’ Level Complete).
- Ensures predictable state changes and separation of responsibilities.

### **2. Singleton Managers**
All common managers exist as **singleton instances**:
- `GameManager` â†’ Handles application-level transitions, layout setup, score updates
- `ScreenManager` â†’ Manages active screens and UI transitions
- `AudioManager` â†’ Centralized sound effects/music
- `EventSystemManager` â†’ Broadcasts game events without direct references

### **3. Event System Manager**
- Cards and UI elements never reference each other directly.
- Events like `OnCardMatched`, `OnCardFlipped`, `OnGameOver` are broadcast from the `EventSystemManager`.
- Reduces coupling and improves maintainability.

---

## ðŸ’¾ Save/Load System
- On **Save**: Stores matched card IDs, current score, and combo in `PlayerPrefs` (JSON serialized).
- On **Load**: Data is retrieved and applied to the current board, restoring flipped/matched states.
- On **Level Completion**: Saved data is cleared to start fresh.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **Assets/Scripts**
  - `Managers/` â€” Singleton-based managers (GameManager, ScreenManager, AudioManager, EventSystemManager, SaveSystem)
  - `Gameplay/` â€” Card controller scripts, match detection, score logic
  - `UI/` â€” Menus, HUD, animations
- **Assets/Prefabs** â€” Reusable card, layout, and UI prefabs
- **Assets/Resources** â€” Sprites, audio clips

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open in **Unity 2021 LTS or later**
2. Open the `MainScene`
3. Press Play in the Editor

---

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
- Visual effects for matches/mismatches
- Configurable difficulty & timed mode
- Online multiplayer with Unity Netcode
